// Serial Data Transfer (Link Cable)
// FF01 - SB - Serial transfer data (R/W)
// 8 Bits of data to be read/written
// FF02 - SC - Serial Transfer Control (R/W)
//   Bit 7 - Transfer Start Flag (0=No Transfer, 1=Start)
//   Bit 1 - Clock Speed (0=Normal, 1=Fast) ** CGB Mode Only **
//   Bit 0 - Shift Clock (0=External Clock, 1=Internal Clock)
// The clock signal specifies the rate at which the eight data bits in SB (FF01) are transferred. When the gameboy
// is communicating with another gameboy (or other computer) then either one must supply internal clock, and the
// other one must use external clock.
// Internal Clock
// In Non-CGB Mode the gameboy supplies an internal clock of 8192Hz only (allowing to transfer about 1 KByte per second).
// In CGB Mode four internal clock rates are available, depending on Bit 1 of the SC register, and on whether the CGB
// Double Speed Mode is used:
//     8192Hz -  1KB/s - Bit 1 cleared, Normal
//    16384Hz -  2KB/s - Bit 1 cleared, Double Speed Mode
//   262144Hz - 32KB/s - Bit 1 set,     Normal
//   524288Hz - 64KB/s - Bit 1 set,     Double Speed Mode
// External Clock
// The external clock is typically supplied by another gameboy, but might be supplied by another computer (for example
// if connected to a PCs parallel port), in that case the external clock may have any speed. Even the old/monochrome
// gameboy is reported to recognizes external clocks of up to 500KHz. And there is no limitiation into the other
// direction - even when suppling an external clock speed of "1 bit per month", then the gameboy will still eagerly wait
// for the next bit(s) to be transferred. It isn't required that the clock pulses are sent at an regular interval either.
// Timeouts
// When using external clock then the transfer will not complete until the last bit is received. In case that the second
// gameboy isn't supplying a clock signal, if it gets turned off, or if there is no second gameboy connected at all) then
// transfer will never complete. For this reason the transfer procedure should use a timeout counter, and abort the
// communication if no response has been received during the timeout interval.
// Delays and Synchronization
// The gameboy that is using internal clock should always execute a small delay between each transfer, in order to ensure
// that the opponent gameboy has enough time to prepare itself for the next transfer, ie. the gameboy with external clock
// must have set its transfer start bit before the gameboy with internal clock starts the transfer. Alternately, the two
// gameboys could switch between internal and external clock for each transferred byte to ensure synchronization.
// Transfer is initiated by setting the Transfer Start Flag. This bit is automatically set to 0 at the end of Transfer.
// Reading this bit can be used to determine if the transfer is still active.
// INT 58 - Serial Interrupt
// When the transfer has completed (ie. after sending/receiving 8 bits, if any) then an interrupt is requested by setting Bit
// 3 of the IF Register (FF0F). When that interrupt is enabled, then the Serial Interrupt vector at 0058 is called.
// XXXXXX...
// Transmitting and receiving serial data is done simultaneously. The received data is automatically stored in SB.
// The serial I/O port on the Gameboy is a very simple setup and is crude compared to standard RS-232 (IBM-PC) or RS-485 (Macintosh)
// serial ports. There are no start or stop bits.
// During a transfer, a byte is shifted in at the same time that a byte is shifted out. The rate of the shift is determined by whether
// the clock source is internal or external.
// The most significant bit is shifted in and out first.
// When the internal clock is selected, it drives the clock pin on the game link port and it stays high when not used. During a
// transfer it will go low eight times to clock in/out each bit.
// The state of the last bit shifted out determines the state of the output line until another transfer takes place.
// If a serial transfer with internal clock is performed and no external GameBoy is present, a value of $FF will be received in the transfer.
